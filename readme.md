# Daily Programming Exercises

Sometimes you forget features of a language and you look them up. We want to stop doing that. We want to be able to code in a language as free and as easily as we can speak.

**You can do this with daily programming exercises.**

Usually you only excercise what you need when you work on a project, but projects don't use alot of features of a language that you should know by heart!

## JavaScript

This is the vanilla JavaScript folder.
Open that folder and follow the instructions. Node.js will be needed.

## React

The React folder has various small React exercises based on using Hooks and Redux Core.

Other languages will be added in the future.
